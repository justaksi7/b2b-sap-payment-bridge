# SAP - B2B-Partner Payments Bridge

## Goal

Design a resilient architecture that **decouples multiple B2B partners from SAP**. The system must guarantee:
- **Durability** (no data loss)
- **Prevention of duplicates**
- **Reliable acknowledgements** to partners even if SAP is slow or down

## Why

 - Ensure every partner request is durably stored before confirming.
 - Support multiple partners with separate authentication, limits, and mapping rules.
 - Keep the system resilient: if SAP is down or overloaded, data is queued and retried until 
successful.
 - Provide visibility (metrics, logs, dashboards).
 - Keep the system secure (auth, signed webhooks, minimal PII).
## Intended Scope
- **Reliability:**  
    Retries with exponential backoff, Dead Letter Queues, Outbox, Idempotency
- **Security:**  
    OAuth2, Signed Webhooks, minimal PII
- **Observability:**  
    Logs, Software Metrics, etc.

## Data and Reliability
### Payments Core database:

**The Payments Core database consists of 3 different tables: payments,  workerOutbox and webhookOutbox**

**payments table:**
|id = string (uuid)|paymentDetails = JSONB object|status = string enum (QUEUED, FAILED, SETTLED)|createdAt = timestamp|updatedAt = timestamp|
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|company12order34 |{"paymentDetails":{} } |QUEUED |	1758264781  |	1758264781             |

**Constraints and keys:**

- id = string (uuid) - This is the primary key with unique constraint. It is a combination of the company identifier and the order identifier. a paymentDetails column could look like this for example: `{
  "paymentDetails": {
    "transactionId": "txn_789456123",
    "amount": 99.99,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "paymentMethod": "credit_card",
    "paymentMethodDetails": {
      "cardType": "visa",
      "lastFourDigits": "1234",
      "expirationDate": "12/2025"
    },
    "billingAddress": {
      "firstName": "Max",
      "lastName": "Mustermann",
      "street": "Musterstra√üe 123",
      "city": "Musterstadt",
      "postalCode": "12345",
      "country": "DE"
    },
    "createdAt": "2023-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-10-05T14:50:30.000Z",
    "metadata": {
      "orderId": "ord_123456",
      "customerId": "cust_789",
      "invoiceNumber": "INV-2023-1005"
    }
  }
}`
- paymentDetails = JSONB object - This is the object that holds the actual payment details. It is a required column.
- status = string enum - This is the status of the payment and it is a required column.
- createdAt = timestamp - This is the timestamp of creation and it is required.
- updatedAt = timestamp - This is the timestamp of the most recent update. It is optional when inserting a row into the table.
