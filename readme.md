# SAP - B2B-Partner Payments Bridge

## Goal

Design a resilient architecture that **decouples multiple B2B partners from SAP**. The system must guarantee:
- **Durability** (no data loss)
- **Prevention of duplicates**
- **Reliable acknowledgements** to partners even if SAP is slow or down

## Why

 - Ensure every partner request is durably stored before confirming.
 - Support multiple partners with separate authentication, limits, and mapping rules.
 - Keep the system resilient: if SAP is down or overloaded, data is queued and retried until 
successful.
 - Provide visibility (metrics, logs, dashboards).
 - Keep the system secure (auth, signed webhooks, minimal PII).
## Intended Scope
- **Reliability:**  
    Retries with exponential backoff, Dead Letter Queues, Outbox, Idempotency
- **Security:**  
    OAuth2, Signed Webhooks, minimal PII
- **Observability:**  
    Logs, Software Metrics, etc.

## Data and Reliability
### Payments Core database:

**The Payments Core database consists of 3 different tables: payments,  workerOutbox and webhookOutbox**

**payments table:**
|id = string (uuid)|paymentDetails = JSONB object|status = string enum (QUEUED, FAILED, SETTLED)|createdAt = timestamp|updatedAt = timestamp|
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
